SMT (Surface Mount Technology) assembly is a process used to manufacture electronic devices by placing surface mount components onto printed circuit boards (PCBs). These components are soldered onto the PCB, which allows for a higher component density and improved electrical performance compared to through-hole assembly. SMT assembly is a common method used in the production of a wide range of electronic devices, including smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics.

In Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly, tiny components are placed directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) and soldered in place using a reflow soldering process. The components used in SMT assembly are much smaller than those used in through-hole assembly, and they have small metal tabs, called leads, on the bottom that make contact with the PCB.

The SMT assembly process typically begins by applying a paste of solder to the PCB where the component leads will be soldered. The components are then placed onto the PCB using a machine called a pick and place machine, which can quickly and accurately position the components in the correct location on the PCB.

Once the components are in place, the PCB is passed through a reflow soldering machine, which uses heat to melt the solder paste and solder the component leads to the PCB. After soldering, the PCB is inspected for any defects, and then cleaned to remove any remaining flux or other contaminants.

The benefits of SMT assembly over through-hole assembly include:

Higher component density, as more components can be placed on a single PCB
Improved electrical performance, as the shorter lead lengths of SMT components result in lower resistance and inductance
Reduced manufacturing costs, as SMT assembly is faster and more efficient than through-hole assembly
Smaller and lighter finished products
However, SMT assembly also has some disadvantages compared to through-hole assembly. The components are more fragile, and if not handled properly, it can lead to damage. Also, some components that are not easily available in SMT form, and also the repair of SMT boards is more difficult than through-hole boards.
