## [Autodesk EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview)

[Autodesk EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview), formerly known as “Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor”, is a popular PCB design software developed by Autodesk. It is one of the most widely used PCB design packages in the world and is used by hobbyists, students, and professionals alike.
Autodesk EAGLE is a comprehensive suite of design tools that allows users to easily design high-quality printed circuit boards (PCBs) quickly and efficiently. 

The user interface is designed to be intuitive, with the ability to switch between tools and layouts with ease. Autodesk EAGLE also offers many features such as Schematic Capture, Layout Design, Component Placement, and Signal Integrity analysis, which makes it an excellent choice for designing complicated PCBs.

In addition to the standard features offered by Autodesk EAGLE, there are also a variety of third-party plugins available which allow you to extend the software’s capabilities even further. 

These plugins include BoardStacks, which provides an automated way of organizing components on your PCB design, and CircuitBuilder, which provides detailed analysis of your PCB layout.

The latest version of Autodesk EAGLE includes an extensive library of parts from various manufacturers and vendors, which can be accessed directly within the application. With the included library, users are able to quickly find the components they need for their design and create their PCB faster.

Overall, Autodesk EAGLE is an excellent choice for creating PCB designs quickly and efficiently. It has a robust feature set and a large library of parts, allowing users to create complex designs with relative ease. It is also easy to use and comes with helpful documentation, making it suitable for both beginners and advanced users alike.

## [OrCAD](https://www.orcad.com/)

[OrCAD](https://www.orcad.com/) is a comprehensive suite of integrated tools for PCB design. It provides a range of features for schematic capture, board layout and design verification. The OrCAD PCB design solutions come in three product offerings: OrCAD Capture, OrCAD Layout, and OrCAD PCB Designer Professional. The suite also offers powerful analysis and design tools to ensure that designs meet their requirements.

OrCAD Capture allows users to quickly create schematic designs, simulate their circuits and generate reports. The tool includes an integrated library of over 30,000 components, allowing users to easily select parts for their designs.
